# Email Verification Check on Login

## Feature Added

When users log in, the system now properly checks if their email is verified and redirects them to the email verification page if not verified.

## How It Works

### Login Flow
1. User enters email and password
2. Credentials are validated with Supabase
3. **Email verification check** is performed
4. User is redirected based on their verification status:
   - ❌ **Email NOT verified** → `/email-verification` page
   - ✅ **Email verified, onboarding NOT completed** → `/onboarding` page
   - ✅ **Email verified, onboarding completed** → `/dashboard` page

## Changes Made

### File: `src/pages/Login.jsx`

**Updated `handleSubmit` function:**

```javascript
// After successful login, check email verification status
const { data: { user: authUser } } = await supabase.auth.getUser()

// Check if email is verified
if (!authUser.email_confirmed_at) {
  setLoading(false)
  navigate("/email-verification", { replace: true })
  return
}
```

**Key improvements:**
- ✅ Added `replace: true` to navigation for cleaner browser history
- ✅ Reset loading state before navigation
- ✅ Early return to prevent further processing
- ✅ Proper error handling with loading state management

## User Experience

### Scenario 1: Unverified Email
1. User signs up but doesn't verify email
2. User tries to log in later
3. Login succeeds (credentials are valid)
4. **Automatically redirected to Email Verification page**
5. User sees their email and can:
   - Wait for verification email
   - Resend verification email
   - Complete verification

### Scenario 2: Verified Email, Incomplete Onboarding
1. User verifies email
2. Closes browser before completing onboarding
3. User logs in again
4. **Automatically redirected to Onboarding page**
5. User completes profile setup

### Scenario 3: Complete Setup
1. User has verified email
2. User has completed onboarding
3. User logs in
4. **Automatically redirected to Dashboard**
5. Ready to use the application

## Benefits

1. **Security**: Ensures only verified emails can access the app
2. **User Guidance**: Automatically guides users to complete required steps
3. **Better UX**: No manual navigation needed
4. **State Persistence**: Users can log out and resume where they left off
5. **Clear Flow**: Enforces proper signup → verify → onboard → use flow

## Email Verification Page Features

When redirected to `/email-verification`, users can:
- See the email address they need to verify
- View clear instructions
- Resend verification email if needed
- Automatic redirect once email is verified

## Testing Instructions

### Test Case 1: Unverified User Login
1. Create a new account (sign up)
2. **Don't click the verification link** in email
3. Go back to login page
4. Enter the credentials
5. Click "Sign In"
6. ✅ **Expected**: Redirected to Email Verification page

### Test Case 2: Resend Verification
1. From Email Verification page
2. Click "Resend Verification Email"
3. ✅ **Expected**: New email sent, confirmation message shown

### Test Case 3: Complete Flow
1. Sign up with new account
2. Log in (redirected to email verification)
3. Check email and click verification link
4. ✅ **Expected**: Automatically redirected to onboarding
5. Complete onboarding
6. ✅ **Expected**: Access to dashboard granted

### Test Case 4: Verified User Login
1. Use account with verified email
2. Log in with credentials
3. ✅ **Expected**: Direct access to dashboard (or onboarding if incomplete)

## Error Handling

The login handles various scenarios:
- Invalid credentials → Shows error message
- Network issues → Shows "Failed to log in" message
- Unverified email → Redirects to verification page (no error)
- Loading state → Button shows "Signing in..." and is disabled

## Technical Details

### Supabase Auth Check
```javascript
const { data: { user: authUser } } = await supabase.auth.getUser()
```

### Email Verification Status
```javascript
authUser.email_confirmed_at // null if not verified, timestamp if verified
```

### Navigation with Replace
```javascript
navigate("/email-verification", { replace: true })
```
- Uses `replace: true` to avoid back button issues
- Prevents users from going back to login after redirect

- `src/pages/EmailVerification.jsx` - Email verification UI
- `src/context/AuthContext.jsx` - Authentication context
- `src/components/ProtectedRoute.jsx` - Route protection logic

## Security Considerations

1. ✅ Email verification is checked server-side (Supabase)
2. ✅ Cannot bypass verification by URL manipulation
3. ✅ ProtectedRoute component enforces verification on all protected pages
4. ✅ Auth state is properly managed throughout the app

**Status:** ✅ **IMPLEMENTED** - Login now checks email verification and redirects accordingly
