# üéØ QUICK START - Fix "Row-Level Security Policy" Error

## The Problem
```
Failed to upload images: new row violates row-level security policy
ERROR: 42P01: relation "storage.policies" does not exist
```

## The Solution (3 Steps)

### üìù STEP 1: Run SQL Script (2 minutes)

1. Open **Supabase Dashboard** ‚Üí **SQL Editor**
2. Copy **ALL** of `supabase-multiple-images-setup.sql`
3. Paste and click **RUN**
4. Wait for "Success" message

### üì¶ STEP 2: Create Storage Bucket (1 minute)

**THIS IS THE MOST IMPORTANT STEP!**

1. Supabase Dashboard ‚Üí **Storage** (left sidebar)
2. Click **"New Bucket"** button
3. Enter details:
   ```
   Name: product-images
   Public: ‚úÖ CHECK THIS BOX!!!
   ```
4. Click **"Create Bucket"**

**‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL:** The "Public" checkbox MUST be checked!

---

### ‚úÖ STEP 3: Verify (30 seconds)

Run this in SQL Editor:

```sql
-- Quick verification
SELECT 
  CASE 
    WHEN EXISTS (SELECT FROM storage.buckets WHERE id = 'product-images' AND public = true)
    THEN '‚úÖ Storage bucket ready!'
    ELSE '‚ùå Storage bucket missing or not public'
  END as status;
```

Should return: `‚úÖ Storage bucket ready!`

  CASE WHEN EXISTS (SELECT FROM storage.buckets WHERE id = 'product-images') 
    THEN '‚úÖ' ELSE '‚ùå Create bucket in Storage' END as result
UNION ALL
SELECT 
  'Bucket is public' as check_1,
  CASE WHEN EXISTS (SELECT FROM storage.buckets WHERE id = 'product-images' AND public = true) 
    THEN '‚úÖ' ELSE '‚ùå Make bucket public' END as result
UNION ALL
SELECT 
  'You are logged in' as check_1,

## üí° Most Common Issues

| Error | Cause | Fix |
|-------|-------|-----|
| "RLS policy violation" | Bucket not created | Create `product-images` bucket |
| "Bucket not found" | Wrong bucket name | Must be exactly `product-images` |
| "Access denied" | Bucket not public | Check "Public" when creating bucket |
| "Not authenticated" | Logged out | Log back in as seller |

## ‚ú® Success Checklist

Before testing, verify:
- ‚úÖ SQL script ran successfully
- ‚úÖ `product-images` bucket exists in Storage
- ‚úÖ Bucket is marked as **Public**
- ‚úÖ You are logged in to the app
- ‚úÖ App code is updated (AddEditProduct.jsx)

---

## üÜò Emergency Fix

If nothing works, temporarily disable RLS to test:

```sql
-- TESTING ONLY - NOT FOR PRODUCTION!
ALTER TABLE product_images DISABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

-- Test upload now...
-- If it works, the issue is RLS policies

-- RE-ENABLE IMMEDIATELY:
ALTER TABLE product_images ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
```

Then properly fix the policies using `fix-rls-policies.sql`
