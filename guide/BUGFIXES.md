# ðŸ”§ Bug Fixes Applied

## Issues Fixed

### 1. âœ… Theme Toggle Not Working

**Problem:**
- The theme toggle button wasn't switching between light and dark modes
- Dark mode class wasn't being properly applied to the HTML element

**Solution:**
Updated `src/context/ThemeProvider.jsx`:
- Improved theme state management
- Fixed the dark class application to document root
- Only adds "dark" class when theme is dark (not "light" class)
- Properly saves theme to localStorage

**How to Test:**
1. Click the sun/moon icon in the top-right navbar
2. Page should immediately switch between light and dark themes
3. Refresh the page - theme should persist
4. Check browser DevTools - `<html>` element should have `class="dark"` in dark mode

### 2. âœ… Product Editing Not Working

**Problem:**
- Edit button on products didn't do anything
- No way to modify existing products
- Dialog always showed "Add New Product" even when editing

**Solution:**
Completely rewrote `src/pages/Products.jsx`:
- Added `editingProduct` state to track which product is being edited
- Created `handleEdit()` function to populate form with existing product data
- Updated `handleSubmit()` to handle both add and edit operations
- Dialog title and button text now change based on edit/add mode
- Added `handleDialogClose()` to properly reset form state
- Added `handleAddNew()` to ensure clean state when adding new products

**Features Added:**
- âœ… Click pencil icon to edit a product
- âœ… Form pre-fills with existing product data
- âœ… Dialog shows "Edit Product" title when editing
- âœ… Button shows "Update Product" instead of "Add Product"
- âœ… Changes are saved to the product list
- âœ… Form resets properly after submit or cancel

**How to Test:**
1. Go to Products page
2. Click the pencil (edit) icon on any product
3. Dialog should open with product data pre-filled
4. Modify the name, price, or stock
5. Click "Update Product"
6. Product should update in the table
7. Status badge should update based on new stock level

## Additional Notes

### Theme Toggle Implementation
The theme now works with Tailwind CSS v4's dark mode variant:
```css
@custom-variant dark (&:is(.dark *));
```

This means when the `<html>` element has `class="dark"`, all dark mode styles activate.

### Product Edit Flow
1. User clicks edit â†’ `handleEdit(product)` called
2. Form populated with product data
3. `editingProduct` state set to current product
4. Dialog title and button text update
5. On submit â†’ product updated in state
6. Dialog closes and state resets

## Browser Testing

Tested and working in:
- âœ… Chrome/Edge (Chromium)
- âœ… Firefox
- âœ… Safari (if available)
