# Bug Fixes - Navigation & Tour Guide

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Signup Page Not Navigating to Email Verification ✅

**Problem:**
- After clicking signup button, the page stayed the same
- Navigation to email verification page wasn't working

**Solution:**
- Updated `Signup.jsx` to use `navigate("/email-verification", { replace: true })` to force navigation
- Fixed error handling to only reset loading state on error (not on success)
- Updated `AuthContext.jsx` signup function to:
  - Add `emailRedirectTo` option to Supabase signup
  - Return user data along with success status
  - Better error handling and validation

**Files Changed:**
- `src/pages/Signup.jsx`
- `src/context/AuthContext.jsx`

### 2. Manual Page Refresh Required ✅

**Problem:**
- After navigating to different pages, content wouldn't update
- Users had to manually refresh the page

**Solution:**
- Updated `App.jsx` to use React Router's `location` key for route remounting
- Created separate `AppRoutes` component that uses `location.pathname` as key
- This forces React to remount components when the route changes
- Added `replace: true` to all navigation redirects in `EmailVerification.jsx`

**Files Changed:**
- `src/App.jsx`
- `src/pages/EmailVerification.jsx`

### 3. Tour Guide First Box Half Hidden ✅

**Problem:**
- The first step of the tour guide was cut off
- Not enough space to display the dialog box properly

**Solution:**
- Enhanced `TourGuide.jsx` with smart scrolling:
  - Added `scrollIntoView` before starting tour
  - Centers the target element in viewport
  - Delays tour start to allow smooth scroll animation
  - Added padding option to TourGuide initialization

- Added custom CSS in `index.css` to fix tour positioning:
  - Maximum height constraint (90vh) with scrolling
  - Proper margins on all sides (20px)
  - Sticky footer for buttons
  - Proper z-index layering
  - Responsive dialog body with max-height
  - Dark mode support

**Files Changed:**
- `src/components/TourGuide.jsx`
- `src/index.css`

## Technical Details

### Navigation Fix
- Uses `replace: true` to replace history entries instead of pushing new ones
- Uses `location.pathname` as key to force component remounting
- Ensures React Router properly updates the view

### Tour Guide Fix
- `scrollIntoView({ behavior: 'smooth', block: 'center' })` centers target
- 400ms delay allows scroll and DOM updates to complete
- CSS constraints prevent dialog overflow
- Sticky footer keeps buttons accessible

## Additional Improvements

2. **Smooth Transitions**: Added animation delays for better UX
3. **Responsive Design**: Tour dialogs adapt to viewport size
4. **Dark Mode**: Tour guide styling works in both light and dark themes
